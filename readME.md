## Project Overview: <a name="Project-Overview"></a>

In fullfilment of the first assignment for the Data Scientist Udacity nanodegree, I completed an analysis of the StackOverflow surveys from 2011 to 2021, answering key questions and trying to understand the data more.

**Background:** 
Surveys have been collected across the years asking participants to reply about various questions concerning being a developer.

**The goal** 
The goal is to better understand the participants' background, the main programming languages used across the years and whether being acquainted with a very requested programming language can lead to an high remuneration.
